# Lambda AOT Compiler

This repository contains the implementation of an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler for the Lambda programming language. The project serves as Dalton Hensley's Bachelor's thesis, conducted as a URF (Undergraduate Research Fellowship) student researcher at Morehead State University.

## Introduction

The Lambda AOT Compiler is designed to provide efficient translation of Lambda programs into machine code that can be executed directly by the target hardware. The primary objective of this project is to explore the possibilities of improving the performance of Lambda programs by leveraging AOT compilation techniques.

## About the Author

This project represents a significant milestone in Dalton's undergraduate research experience.

## Compiler Design

The Lambda AOT Compiler follows a standard compilation pipeline, which consists of several stages, each contributing to the transformation of source code into optimized machine code. The major stages of the compiler's design include:

1. **Preprocessing**: In the preprocessing stage, the compiler performs initial transformations on the source code. This may involve removing comments, handling preprocessor directives, and resolving include statements to gather all necessary dependencies.

2. **Lexical Analysis**: The next stage is lexical analysis, where the source code is divided into individual tokens. The compiler scans the input program, recognizing and categorizing tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. This stage is crucial for providing a structured representation of the source code to the subsequent stages.

3. **Parsing**: Parsing is the process of analyzing the sequence of tokens generated by the lexical analysis stage and constructing a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST). The parser verifies the syntactic correctness of the code based on a specified grammar, ensuring that it adheres to the language's syntax rules.

4. **Semantic Analysis**: After the code is parsed, the compiler performs semantic analysis. This stage checks the validity and meaning of the program beyond its syntax. It includes tasks such as type checking, scope resolution, and detecting semantic errors. The compiler ensures that the program conforms to the language's semantics and resolves any ambiguities or inconsistencies.

5. **LLVM Code Generation**: Once the code has undergone semantic analysis, the compiler generates intermediate code in the LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) representation. LLVM provides a set of reusable compiler infrastructure components that facilitate optimization and code generation for a wide range of target architectures. The generated LLVM code serves as an intermediate representation before further optimization and translation to machine code.

6. **Optimization**: The compiler applies various optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and performance of the generated code. These optimizations include constant folding, dead code elimination, loop optimization, and more. Optimization aims to minimize execution time, reduce memory usage, and enhance overall program performance.

7. **Machine Code Generation**: The final stage of the compilation pipeline involves translating the optimized LLVM intermediate code into machine code specific to the target hardware architecture. This step transforms the code into executable instructions that can be directly executed by the target hardware, resulting in an AOT-compiled binary.

By following this compilation pipeline, the Lambda AOT Compiler ensures the accurate translation of Lambda source code into efficient and optimized machine code.

## LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)
LLVM provides a versatile and efficient intermediate representation (IR) that
serves as a platform-independent representation of code during compilation.
LLVM IR is a low-level, strongly-typed, and well-defined language that captures
the semantics of a program.

The Lambda AOT Compiler leverages LLVM IR as an intermediate step between the
frontend (parsing and semantic analysis) and the backend (code generation). By
translating Lambda source code into LLVM IR, the compiler gains access to a
wide range of powerful optimization techniques and can target multiple hardware
architectures without the need for manual reimplementation.

LLVM IR consists of a set of typed instructions, representing various
operations, control flow structures, and memory access. It provides a rich set
of features, including support for high-level constructs, such as functions,
loops, conditionals, and complex data structures.

## LLVM Compiler Backend
The LLVM compiler backend is responsible for taking LLVM IR as input and
translating it into optimized machine code that can be executed by the target
hardware architecture. It consists of a set of components and optimizations
that transform the LLVM IR into efficient and performant machine code.
