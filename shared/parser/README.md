## Morehead Azalea Compiler (MAC) Parser Implementation 

MAC's parser is an essential part of the compiler that takes the stream of tokens
generated by the lexer as input and examines their structure in accordance with
the grammar's rules for the language's syntax. It evaluates whether the given
token order constitutes a legitimate program and then generates the appropriate
parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST).
