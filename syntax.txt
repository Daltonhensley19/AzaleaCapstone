Prologue:
    - This document outlines experimental syntax for "Lambda" language. 
    
    - Goal 1: Expression based.
    - Goal 2: Statically typed.
    - Goal 3: Contains fundamental constructs (control flow, vars, application,
      iteration/repetition, etc.)
    - Goal 4: Half-decent compiler error messages.
