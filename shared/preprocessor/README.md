## Morehead Azalea Compiler (MAC) Preprocessor Implementation 

Before lexical and syntactic analysis, the preprocessor in MAC performs
text manipulation operations on the source code. Preprocessor directives are
unique instructions that change the source code before compilation; they are
handled by this function. A noteworthy example: MAC's preprocessor strips
C-like comments from source files.
